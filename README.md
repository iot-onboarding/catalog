# IoT Onboarding Mechanisms

Welcome to the catalog of IoT onboarding mechanisms.  There are several goals of this catalog:

- Help developers choose which mechanism might be best for their products
- Help end users find products that might be best for their environments
- Find architectural commonality between the different mechanisms available
- Provide pointers to additional information about each of the different mechanisms available

The catalog is still in early development.  PRs are welcome.  To date, what exists are two key files:

- The Mechanism list, which describes as many mechanisms as we could find.
- A concise table format intended to roughly capture that same information, with some additional editorial thoughts.

Again, feel free to edit or add.  Especially if you have references.

There's an email list to discuss all of this: iot-onboarding@ietf.org.  You can subscribe by going to https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/iot-onboarding.
